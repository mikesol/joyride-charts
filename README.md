# Joyride charts

For now, a private repo with scripts that generate charts for joyride.

## Why?

Even though the joyride visual editor is convenient, I think faster and better through code.

Also, by using a scripting language (in this case PureScript), it's easier to have precision timing and to achieve effects like symmetry.
